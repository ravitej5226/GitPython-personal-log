# GitPython-personal-log
This script is specifically for a need in my team project.
After committing a set of files in the GIT repository, a log file is maintained with the author name and the relative paths of all files in the commit. The log file is stored in a separate log repository. 

This script automates the process of the getting the set of files from the source commit, updating the log file and pushing the updated log file into log repo.
fyi, The log file and format of the logs is specific to my team's need.
